                        <p>&emsp;This is my first javascript project. When I first tried to learn javascript, I was focused on only the theories of javascript. 
                          Studying by taking notes, and memorizing javascript concepts only showed me how complex javascript is rather than showing me the purpose of using this language.
                          But I could not give up as I thought javascript was a step that I must take in order to move forward towards my future career. I decided to try <strong>project-based learning</strong> and
                          searched for javascript projects online. I clone coded this simple tetris game by typing each code and understanding it as I went through. To test myself if 
                          I fully understand my code, I added more features to the game such as pause, hold block, and show next block. Adding hold block function was easy as all I had to do was 
                          erase current moving block and re-rendering it to hold box when a button was pressed. However, adding a function to show the next block required me to go through my
                          code many times. I had to make changes to functions that initialize the game to start so that the generated blocks renders in queue box first
                          instead of rendering immediately on the screen. In order to implement this function, I used two variables, tempNextItem and nextItem, to save the generated blocks
                          in the queue box before the current moving block is seized. From this project, I learned the importance of project-based learning and going further than just cloning the codes
                          to fully understand what I programmed.

                    <p>&emsp;After getting familiar with javascript, I went on to learn a very useful and popular library: React.js<br>
                      By using create-react-app, I learned about states, props, JSX, fetching data from api service, and routing to different pages. As it was my first time using
                      api keys to fetch data, I did not know that I must hide my api key from my user. I learned about .env files and .gitignore files after searching for 
                      methods to hide my api key before pushing my project to github. However, my api key was still shown in network requests of my site. To fix this, I re-created
                      my project on a framework called next.js. Next.js provided url re-write function so that I can first send the user to a temporary page before
                      fetching the data, and then re-direct the user to actual page after masking the url. This way, the user is not able to view requests and does not know the difference in the url.

                      &emsp;This is my first react native project. From clone coding this weather app on the internet, I learned to work with 
                      expo, react native foundations, styles on react native, and icons that expo provides. I used openweathermap api to fetch
                      data from the json file. After I clone coded showing the city, date, and temperature, I added more features to the app.
                      I applied what I learned to add humidity, sunrise/sunset, UVIndex, and wind speed of 7 days from current day. I could 
                      implement all parts of the app without significant problems since the basics were very similar with react.js.

                      &emsp;This is my second project with react native. I learned to work with asyncStorage in react native, which is similar
                      to localStorage on the web. I clone coded adding the todo on the list, then went on to implement delete, edit, and crossing out the todos in the list. 
                      Implementing edit function took the longest time because the app had to show an input component instead of the todo when the user pressed on the edit button.
                      To implement the function, I created a new state called editing to check if the user is trying to edit. I also took the
                      todo box and made it into a separate component. When editing state is true, it shows the input box and changes it back to
                      todo component when the user is done editing.
